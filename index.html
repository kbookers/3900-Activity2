			<p>Love cooking, but hate sifting through billions of recipes to try to find the best one? Us too! We're on a mission to try out as many recipes we can for dishes that you suggest and complie the best ones.</p>

			<p>We started out as a group of friends sharing our favorite recipes with one another. After a few conversations about how difficult it is to find the <em>perfect</em> recipe, we decided to combine our love of cooking with our desire to help others. Thus, Best of the Best: Recipes Edition was born. </p>
				
            <img class="chefimage" src="cooking.jpg"/>

			<p>So what determines what makes a recipie the <strong>best</strong>?</p>

			<p>Great question! We grade the recipes we test using scales based on ease of replicating, time required to complete, and taste. You can even sort by your preference using our filter option. </p>
